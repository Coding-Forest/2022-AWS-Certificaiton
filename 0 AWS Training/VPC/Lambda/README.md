# üêëLambda 

## Prerequisite concepts

**Serverless**  
  - `serverless != no server`
  - Servers in the cloud that require zero-configuration/maintenance from the developer. 
    - Now that said, you don't have to...
      - Pick operating system
      - Configure networking
      - Patch dependencies
      - Provision capacity   
  - serverless means you, as a developer, don't have to worry about the server behind the scene.  
  - You don't have to...:
    - write code for a server
    - create a server
    - deploy a server  
    - maintain the server
  - Just don't worry about the infrastructure, focus on your programming (service development). 
  - The host cloud platform will take care of the server side issues.
