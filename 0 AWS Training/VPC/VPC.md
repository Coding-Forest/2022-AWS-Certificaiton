# üìùNotes 

## Basics

  - CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
    - `172.31.0.0/16`
      - a total of 32-bit address system (four binary octets)
      - `/16`: subnet mask

  RFC1918
    - `10.0.0.0` (10/8 prefix)
    - `172.16.0.0` (172.16/12 prefix) 
    - `192.168.0.0` (192.168/16 prefix)
  
  Packet 
    - "In networking, a packet is a small segment of a larger message. Data sent over computer networks*, such as the Internet, is divided into packets. These packets are then recombined by the computer or device that receives them."

  Route table
  
  Network ACLs (Stateless firewalls)
    - default: allow and deny all traffic 
    - Security group, however, is set to deny all inbound/outbound traffic to and from the VPC by default.

  Security group
    - AWS' autoscaling: 
      - Without autoscaling, you have to allocate IP addresses for additional servers; update security group (this applies to both cases where you add a server and remove a server).
      - With autoscaling, the security group is automatically updated (because we know the traffic is bottlenecked at which port range).
        - This is also helpful in enhancing üî•firewall securityüõ°Ô∏è.

## Recap

  - 1) Set IP address.
  - 2) Allocate subnets.
  - 3) Route table + Gateway (create a path to the entry point)
  - 4) Security group (Network ACL, configure the conditions for network  connection)
