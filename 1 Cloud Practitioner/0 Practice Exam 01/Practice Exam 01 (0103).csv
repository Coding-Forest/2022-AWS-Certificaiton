However, the cloud agility requires you to adapt your forecasting processes and tools to match the dynamic nature of your usage. Set up custom budgets and stay informed of how your cost and usage progress and respond quickly when cost or usage exceeds threshold. AWS Budgets allows you to set custom budgets to track your cost and usage from the simplest to the most complex use cases. With AWS Budgets, you can choose to be alerted by email or SNS notification when actual or forecasted cost and usage exceed your budget threshold, or when your actual RI and Savings Plans' utilization or coverage drops below your desired threshold. With AWS Budget Actions, you can also configure specific actions to respond to cost and usage status in your accounts, so that if your cost or usage exceeds or is forecasted to exceed your threshold, actions can be executed automatically or with your approval to reduce unintentional over-spending.  AWS Budgets integrates with multiple other AWS services, such as AWS Cost Explorer, so you can easily view and analyze your cost and usage drivers, AWS Chatbot, so you can receive Budget alerts in your designated Slack channel or Amazon Chime room, and AWS Service Catalog, so you can track cost on your approved AWS portfolios and products.",,https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-budgets/,,
