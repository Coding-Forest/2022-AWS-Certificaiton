## Availability    
  
The server/application is up and running. It keeps serving the visitors;  
Host your application across multiple regions for disaster recovery.  
  
  
- 🔑Key concepts 
  - **High availability**   
  - **Global availability** 
    - Horizontal, geographical, across physical areas  
  
- Example statements 
  - Global availability 
    - You have a mission-critical application which must be _**globally available**_ at all times.
      - Multiple regions   
    - An international company needs to provide low-latency applications for **_customers around the world_**.
        - Global reach (vs. high availability?)

## Elasticity

Quantitative in nature;  
About traffic volume - how many users? how much traffic?

## ☁️Cloud Architecture & Principles

Loose coupling - even if one component fails, the entire system won't fail.  
Everything will fail - helps build a highly available + fault-tolerant system.

**MySQL**   
**NoSQL** (AI Holic, 2020)  
  - Scalability
    - Horisonzal scalailbity
      - Data access speed: O(1) using hashing 
      - Horizontal scalability - Throughput will increase if you increase the number of servers. 
        - Reliable scalability owing to the data access speed (O(1)) 
        - Horizontal scalability reduces risks in terms of engineering. 
      - DynamoDB is a NoSQL databased fully managed by AWS. 

- SQL language
  - Unified SQL language vs no language
  - SQL for structured data
  - NoSQL for UNstructured data
  
- Schema 
  - Strict schema vs Schema-free
  - Strict schema for structured data
  - Schema-free for UNstructured data
