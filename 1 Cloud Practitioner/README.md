  - 🔑 Terms & Concepts
    - latency (time delay)


## **🌐AWS Global Infrastructure🏗️**

[Fault Tolerance](https://app.exampro.co/student/material/clf-c01/3409)

  - Fault domain
    - A section of a network that is vulnerable to damage if a critical device or system fails. The purpose of a fault domain is that if a failure occurs it wil not casecade outside that domain, limiting the damage possible.
  - Failure Zone (fault domain)
    - Each AZ is designed as an independent failure zone (=fault domain). 

  **Multi-AZ for High Availability⬆️**
  
  - If an application is partitioned across AZs, companies are better isolated and protected from issues such as power outages🔌, lightning strikes🌩️, tornadoes🌪️, earthquakes🌏, and more. 
 
<br>

  **🌐AWS Global Network**
  
  - Interconnections between AWS Global Infrastructure (a kind of a private expresshway where things can move very fast between datacentres)

<br>

  **Tier 1**
  
  - A network🌐 that can reach every other network on the internet without purchasing IP transit or paying for peering. 

<br>

  [**Amazon CloudFront🌤️**](https://app.exampro.co/student/material/clf-c01/3412)
  
  - A Content Delivery Network (CDN) service that you point your website🌐 to CloudFront so that it will route requests to nearest Edge Location cache.

<br>

  **Cloud Architect🏗️☁️**
    
  - Availability - to ensure a service remains available (highly available, HA)
    - Ensure that there is **NO single point of failure** 
    - **Elastic Load Balancer**
      - allows you to evenly distribute traffic to multiple servers in one or more datacentre. If a dat acentre or server becomes unavailble, the load balancer will route the traffic to only available datacentres with servers.
  - Scalability - to grow rapidly or unimpeded.
  - Elasticity - to shrink and grow to meet the demand.
  - Fault Tolerance - to prevent a failure
  - Disaster Recovery - to recover from a failure (highly durable, DR)

  (Security) how secure is this solution?
  (Cost) how much is this going to cost?
