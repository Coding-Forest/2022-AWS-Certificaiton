## âš™ Key Components & Key Concepts  

**<span id="1">1. RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)**</span>  

  - Relation DB is a type of database where datasets have specifically defined relationships between them.
  - RDB concepts: primary key, foreign key, SQL
  - RDBMS: Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MariaDB

<br>  

**<span id="2">2. RDS (Relational Database Services)**</span>  

  - cloud RDBMS that is easily configured, maanged and scaled.
  - Amazon RDS:
    - Automating time-consuming operation tasks (hardware provisioning, database configuration, patching and backup)
    - Cost-effective and scalable DB 

<br>  

**<span id="3">3. RDS characteristics**</span>  

  1) Elastic scaling of instance and storage
    - CPU and memory options 
    - integrate with CloudWatch (elastic scaling according to traffic volume)
    - General Purpose (SSD) for normal workload
    - Provisioned IOPS (SSD) for high speed and large-scale processing
    - Magnetic for infrequent small workload

  2) Easy backup and recovery
    - Inter-AZ DB synchronisation
    - High availability: automatic db failover  

  3) High availability across multiple AZs
  4) Enhanced security with RDS encryption 
  5) DB migration
